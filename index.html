            Today is the end of the Republic. The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder. 
            At this very moment in a system far from here, the New Republic lies to the galaxy while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. <br>
            This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate, to their cherished fleet. 
            All remaining systems will bow to the First Order and will remember this as the last day of the Republic!

    <p>"It is the task of the First Order to remove the disorder from our own existence, 
        so that civilization may be returned to the stability that promotes progress. 
        A stability that existed under the Empire, was reduced to anarchy by the Rebellion, 
        was inherited in turn by the so-called Republic, and will be restored by us. 
        Future historians will look upon this as the time when a strong hand brought the rule of law back to civilization."
